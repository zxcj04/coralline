Gauges change color as they fill: green → yellow at 50% → red at 75% (thresholds configurable).

## Subagent panel

Claude Code shows an agent panel below the prompt while subagents run; each row
defaults to `name · description · token count`. coralline can render those rows
in your theme instead — agent name, **per-task model**, a context gauge, and
elapsed time:

```text
 Explore ◆ Haiku 4.5 ⬡ ▰▰▱▱▱ 21% 42.0k ⧖ 2m
 executor ◆ Fable 5 ⬡ ▰▰▰▱▱ 78% 155.0k ⧖ 45s
```

Opt in from the setup flow (`bash ~/.claude/coralline/configure.sh`): answer `y`
to *Render subagent panel rows*. This registers `subagentStatusLine` in
`~/.claude/settings.json` pointing at `statusline.sh --subagent`; answering `n`
later removes it again.

Per-task `model`/`contextWindowSize` need Claude Code **v2.1.205+**; on older
versions (or before a task's model resolves) rows degrade gracefully — the
missing pieces are simply omitted. Per-subagent *effort* is not shown because
Claude Code does not expose it per task, and the panel's **main-session row is
drawn by Claude Code itself** — it is not part of the `subagentStatusLine`
protocol, so coralline cannot theme it.

`VL_SUB_SEGMENTS` (default `"name model ctx elapsed"`) picks and orders the row
segments. These four are the complete set:

| Segment | Shows | Hidden when |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | task name (first of `name` / `label` / `description` / `type`), colored by status — running: text color, completed: ok, failed: hot, missing/unknown: dim | all four fields empty |
| `model` | `◆` short model name (`claude-haiku-4-5-…` → `Haiku 4.5`; unknown IDs shown verbatim) | model not resolved yet, or pre-v2.1.205 |
| `ctx` | `⬡` context gauge + token count; bare count without `contextWindowSize` | no `tokenCount` |
| `elapsed` | `⧖` wall-clock since `startTime` (epoch s/ms or UTC ISO) | `startTime` missing or unparseable |

The renderer shares your config file but reads only the knobs that shape a row:
`VL_STYLE` with its per-style knobs — the pill caps and separator (`VL_CAP_L`,
`VL_CAP_R`, `VL_SEP`) and the lean/classic family (`VL_LEAN_SEP`, `VL_LEAN_BG`,
`VL_LEAN_CAP_L`/`VL_LEAN_CAP_R`, `VL_LEAN_FG`, `VL_BG_BAR`) — `VL_ASCII`,
`VL_NAME_MAX` (recommended — panel labels are long, and overlong rows are
clipped from the right, hiding model/ctx first), the gauge knobs
(`VL_BAR_WIDTH`, `VL_BAR_FILL`, `VL_BAR_EMPTY`, `VL_WARN_PCT`, `VL_HOT_PCT`),
the shared palette (`VL_FG_TEXT`, `VL_FG_DIM`, `VL_FG_OK`, `VL_FG_WARN`,
`VL_FG_HOT`), and the row colors `VL_BG_SUB_NAME` / `VL_BG_SUB_MODEL` /
`VL_BG_SUB_CTX` / `VL_BG_SUB_ELAPSED` (empty = fall back to `VL_BG_DIR` /
`VL_BG_MODEL` / `VL_BG_CTX` / `VL_BG_DURATION`). Everything else —
`VL_SEGMENTS*`, layout (`VL_LAYOUT`, `VL_MAX_LINES`, `VL_WRAP_MARGIN`), clock,
cost, lines, float, limit-sync, burn, git, and the runtime segments — is
main-bar-only and ignored here. To theme panel rows independently of the main
bar, point the registration at its own config file:
`CORALLINE_CONFIG=~/.claude/coralline-subagent.conf bash ~/.claude/coralline/statusline.sh --subagent`.

## Install

Three ways to install, all driven by the same `install.sh`. Each one copies the renderer **and
the setup wizard** into `~/.claude/coralline` and registers the status line in Claude Code, so
you can re-run the wizard later no matter which way you installed.

> **Requirements:** `jq` and a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) terminal. No Nerd Font?
> Set `VL_ASCII=1` in your config for a glyph-free rendering.

### Ask Claude (recommended)

Paste this into Claude Code:

```text
Please install coralline for me:
fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nanako0129/coralline/main/INSTALL.md
and follow the playbook in it.
```

Claude will read the playbook, use the same installer to bootstrap the runtime, interview you
about the look, write the config, verify it, and remind you that you can rerun the visual
wizard if the first result doesn't match your taste.

If your Claude flags the playbook and wants to inspect things first, that is the right
instinct, not an obstacle: see [Trust and security](#trust-and-security).

### Install it yourself

Run the installer in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nanako0129/coralline/main/install.sh | bash
```

When run interactively it asks which version to install — the latest tagged release
(recommended) or `main` (latest development). To skip the prompt, pin one explicitly with
`--ref`, e.g. `... | bash -s -- --ref v0.9.1` or `--ref main`.

### Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nanako0129/coralline ~/.claude/coralline-src
mkdir -p ~/.claude/coralline/themes
cp ~/.claude/coralline-src/statusline.sh ~/.claude/coralline/
cp ~/.claude/coralline-src/configure.sh ~/.claude/coralline/
cp ~/.claude/coralline-src/install.sh ~/.claude/coralline/
cp ~/.claude/coralline-src/themes/claude-coral.conf ~/.claude/coralline/themes/
```

Then add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "bash ~/.claude/coralline/statusline.sh",
    "refreshInterval": 1
  }
}
```

> **Note:** the commands above copy only the `claude-coral` theme. The Ask-Claude and one-line
> installers bundle every theme; after a manual install, copy the rest of
> `~/.claude/coralline-src/themes/*.conf` into `~/.claude/coralline/themes/` to switch themes.

### Updating

Two ways to update, both driven by the same installer. Either way your
`~/.claude/coralline.conf` is preserved and the previous `statusline.sh` is backed up
under `~/.claude/coralline/` (the 3 newest are kept).

#### Ask Claude (recommended)

Paste this into Claude Code:

```text
Please update coralline for me:
fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nanako0129/coralline/main/UPGRADE.md
and follow the playbook in it.
```

Claude re-runs the installer, reads the "new since your installed copy" report, and
offers to turn on any new opt-in features for you.

#### Update it yourself

Re-run the installer — it prints a short "new since your installed copy" report when
something new shipped:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nanako0129/coralline/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --install-only
```

## Trust and security

The Ask-Claude install is a remote document that instructs an AI to run `curl | bash` and
touch `~/.claude/settings.json`. That shape is exactly what a prompt-injection attack looks
like, so a Claude that red-flags it before proceeding is behaving correctly. The answer to
that skepticism is inspection, not trust:

- **Read what runs.** Everything is in this repo: [install.sh](./install.sh) (about 270
  lines) copies files and merges one `statusLine` key into `settings.json`, and
  [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) is the playbook the AI follows. Have your Claude read both
  before approving anything; that is the intended flow.
- **Pin a release.** `... | bash -s -- --ref v0.9.1` installs a tagged release instead of
  `main`, so what you audited is what you run. The interactive installer already offers the
  latest tag by default.
- **What gets written, exactly:** files under `~/.claude/coralline/`, your choices in
  `~/.claude/coralline.conf`, and one `statusLine` entry merged into
  `~/.claude/settings.json` (a timestamped `settings.json.bak.*` backup is created first).
  Nothing else.
- **What runs afterwards:** `statusline.sh` renders on every prompt. It is pure bash and
  makes zero network requests at runtime; the only external commands are one `jq` call and
  one `git` call per render. Your prompts, keys, and usage data never leave the machine.
- **Why INSTALL.md addresses the AI:** humans get the visual wizard, AIs get an interview
  script, so the playbook speaks to the reader that executes it. A document that opens by
  addressing your AI deserves scrutiny, which is why every artifact it references lives in
  this repo where both of you can read it first.

### Uninstall

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/coralline ~/.claude/coralline.conf
```

Then delete the `statusLine` block from `~/.claude/settings.json` (or restore the newest
`settings.json.bak.*`). Nothing else is left behind.

## Setup

Both paths use the same installer. Humans run it with no mode and get the visual setup. Claude
uses it with `--install-only`, then follows `INSTALL.md` to interview you and write config.

### Setup modes

| Mode | Use when |
|---|---|
| Default | You want the coralline default immediately |
| Powerlevel10k import | You already have `~/.p10k.zsh` and want to carry over its style, time format, and main colors |
| Visual wizard | You want to preview themes, style, segments, wrapping, clock, and font compatibility before writing config |

Running the installer yourself with no mode opens the interactive setup. Claude should not
operate that TUI unless you explicitly ask for visual customization.

### Reconfigure

Every install path copies the wizard into `~/.claude/coralline`, so you can rerun it anytime to
restyle:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/coralline/configure.sh
```

### Testing a fork

Point the installer at the same fork:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOU/coralline/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --repo YOU/coralline
```

## Configuration

Everything lives in `~/.claude/coralline.conf` (plain bash, sourced by the script):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VL_STYLE` | `pill` | `pill`: powerline pills · `lean`: flat colored text · `classic`: lean on a uniform dark bar (p10k classic) |
| `VL_LAYOUT` | `fixed` | `fixed`: one line per `VL_SEGMENTS*` var · `auto`: responsive |
| `VL_MAX_LINES` | `3` | `auto` only — wrap into at most this many lines (`1` = never wrap) |
| `VL_WRAP_MARGIN` | `4` | `auto` only — columns kept free on the right so segments never touch the edge |
| `VL_SEGMENTS` | `dir git model ctx limit5h limit7d cost clock` | segments on line 1, in order (the full list in `auto` mode) |
| `VL_SEGMENTS2` / `VL_SEGMENTS3` | _(empty)_ | `fixed` only — optional second/third line |
| `VL_CLOCK` | `12h` | `12h` / `24h` / `off` |
| `VL_CLOCK_SECONDS` | `1` | show seconds in the clock |
| `VL_BAR_WIDTH` | `5` | gauge width in cells |
| `VL_PATH_DEPTH` | `4` | collapse paths deeper than this |
| `VL_NAME_MAX` | `0` | max chars for the `project` / `git` names before `…` truncation (`0` = off) |
| `VL_COST_DECIMALS` | `2` | decimal places for the cost segment |
| `VL_WARN_PCT` / `VL_HOT_PCT` | `50` / `75` | gauge color thresholds |
| `VL_ASCII` | `0` | `1` disables Nerd Font glyphs |
| `VL_RUNTIME_PROBE` | `0` | `node` / `python`: `1` = also detect via `node` / `python3` on `PATH` when no pin file (forks per render) |
| `VL_BG_*` / `VL_FG_*` | theme | colors — `256`-color index or `"R,G,B"` |

### Burn-rate segment

![The burn segment in a full statusline, and each of its states](./assets/burn-segment.png)

Off by default. Add `burn` to `VL_SEGMENTS` to show a "range to empty" — the projected
time until whichever rate limit (5h or 7d) binds first, e.g. `↗ 5h ⇢ 1h58m`. Keys:
`CORALLINE_BURN_WINDOW` (recent-slope lookback, default 600s), `VL_BURN_GLYPH` (default
`↗`), `VL_BG_BURN` (defaults to the 5h background). While `burn` is in the segment list,
coralline writes samples to `~/.claude/coralline/burn-5h.tsv`; drop it from the list and
nothing is written.

The ETA is coloured by urgency against the window reset, and collapses to a glyph when a
number would be noise:

| You see | When |
|---|---|
| `↗ 5h ⇢ 1h58m` **red** | you'd empty *before* the window resets |
| `↗ 5h ⇢ 1h58m` **yellow** | reset and empty are a close call |
| `↗ 5h ⇢ 1h58m` **green** | the window resets with room to spare |
| **bright** `↗ ✓` | at this pace a full window can't run dry — a number like `24d15h` would just be noise |
| **dim** `↗ ✓` | idle: you've stopped burning, nothing in flight |
| **dim** `↗ …` | warming up: a cold start with no samples yet (deliberately *not* a green check, so a fresh install doesn't read as healthy) |

The label tells you which limit binds — whichever of `5h`/`7d` will hit 100% soonest.
`5h` only appears once you're burning hard enough to register at least two integer-%
steps within the recent window; at a light or steady pace there's no short-term slope to
fit, so the 7d projection binds and you see `↗ 7d`.

### Cross-session limit sync (optional)

`VL_LIMIT_SYNC=1` makes `limit5h` / `limit7d` show the freshest rate-limit reading any of your sessions has seen, instead of just this session's own snapshot. Each render records its `5h` / `7d` value to a small per-host store (`limit-5h.d` / `limit-7d.d`), and the segments display the highest percentage recorded for the current window. Off by default.

This exists because Claude Code re-renders a session's statusline only when that session is active, and the rate-limit numbers it passes are that session's last-seen values. So idle sessions show stale, divergent percentages. With sync on, every session converges to the latest known value the next time it redraws.

> **It only updates on redraw.** It cannot refresh a session that is not redrawing at all, and "latest known" is only as fresh as your most recently active session. coralline has no API access. So this narrows the gap between sessions, it does not make a fully idle bar live.

Single-session users gain nothing from it (there is only one snapshot), so it stays opt-in.

### Responsive layout

With `VL_LAYOUT="auto"` the bar stays on a single line while it fits, and greedily wraps into
up to `VL_MAX_LINES` rows when the window gets narrow. Once the line cap is reached, remaining
segments overflow on the last line. `VL_WRAP_MARGIN` keeps a few columns free on the right so
wrapped lines never butt against the window edge — raise it if your terminal adds padding.

Width comes from `$COLUMNS`. Claude Code v2.1.153+ sets `COLUMNS` to the current terminal width
before running the status line, so wrapping responds to window resizing out of the box. Outside
Claude Code the script falls back to `stty size` on the controlling terminal; if neither is
available it stays on one line.

```text
wide window:    ~/dev/app  ⎇ main  ◆ Fable 5  ⬡ ▰▰▰▱▱ 62%  5h ▰▰▱▱▱ 41%  $1.23  ⊙ 14:45

narrow window:  ~/dev/app  ⎇ main  ◆ Fable 5
                ⬡ ▰▰▰▱▱ 62%  5h ▰▰▱▱▱ 41%  $1.23  ⊙ 14:45
```

Prefer a layout that never moves? Keep `VL_LAYOUT="fixed"` and pin rows with
`VL_SEGMENTS` / `VL_SEGMENTS2` / `VL_SEGMENTS3`.

### Lean style

Prefer Powerlevel10k's *lean* look — no backgrounds, just colored text? Set
`VL_STYLE="lean"` and each segment's `VL_BG_*` color becomes its text accent instead:

![Lean style compared with pill style](./assets/style-lean.png)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VL_STYLE` | `pill` | set to `lean` for the flat look |
| `VL_LEAN_SEP` | _(empty)_ | extra text between segments, e.g. `·` |
| `VL_LEAN_FG` | _(empty)_ | force a text color; empty = inherit each segment's accent |
| `VL_LEAN_BG` | _(empty)_ | paint one uniform background behind the row — `"R,G,B"` or 256 index. For the full p10k *classic* look, prefer the `VL_STYLE="classic"` preset below — it wires this up for you |
| `VL_LEAN_CAP_R` | _(empty)_ | trailing cap glyph drawn in the `VL_LEAN_BG` color to bevel the bar's end into the terminal (p10k's end separator, e.g. `$''`); needs `VL_LEAN_BG` |
| `VL_LEAN_CAP_L` | _(empty)_ | leading cap glyph — the left-facing mirror of `VL_LEAN_CAP_R` at the bar's start (e.g. `$''`); needs `VL_LEAN_BG`. Stock p10k *classic* leaves it flat |

> **Tip:** already a p10k user? Tell the AI installer or the visual wizard to import your
> `~/.p10k.zsh` — it will carry over your style, colors, and time format after you opt in.
> See the [AI interview notes in INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md#ai-interview).

### Classic style

Want Powerlevel10k's stock *classic* prompt — one uniform dark bar with colored
text and a solid end cap? Set `VL_STYLE="classic"`. It's a one-word preset: it
renders like `lean` on a dark bar (p10k's `POWERLEVEL9K_BACKGROUND`) with a
trailing powerline cap, no other knobs required.

![Classic style](./assets/style-classic.png)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VL_STYLE` | `pill` | set to `classic` for the p10k dark-bar look |
| `VL_BG_BAR` | _(empty → `238`)_ | the uniform bar color behind the row — `"R,G,B"` or 256 index. Any theme's palette rides this bar; grayscale palettes (e.g. `mono`) want an explicit `VL_BG_BAR` for contrast |

Under the hood `classic` is `lean` plus a `VL_LEAN_BG` (from `VL_BG_BAR`) and a
`VL_LEAN_CAP_R` end cap, so an explicit `VL_LEAN_BG` or cap still wins. Importing
a p10k *classic* config carries over your exact bar color and separator.

## Float readout (optional)

`VL_FLOAT=1` makes `statusline.sh` write a one-line **plain-text** readout to
`~/.claude/coralline/float.txt` on every render (segments from
`VL_FLOAT_SEGMENTS`, default `model ctx cost`). That's all coralline does —
it ships **no display carrier**. The file is the seam: pipe it wherever you want
a glanceable readout that stays visible without looking at Claude Code's bottom
statusline (a terminal status bar, tmux, a menu-bar app, …).

The readout is **plain text** (no ANSI color), so the default favors stable,
glance-friendly segments and leaves the color-driven limit warnings
(`limit5h` / `limit7d`) in the bottom statusline, where threshold colors work.
You can still add them to `VL_FLOAT_SEGMENTS` if you want the numbers up top.

**Config keys**

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VL_FLOAT` | `0` | `1` = write `float.txt` each render |
| `VL_FLOAT_SEGMENTS` | `model ctx cost` | segments rendered into the readout (plain text, no color) |
| `VL_FLOAT_SEP` | `  ·  ` | separator between segments |
| `VL_FLOAT_FILE` | `~/.claude/coralline/float.txt` | where the readout is written |

(Or toggle `VL_FLOAT` via "float readout" in `configure.sh`'s Details menu.)

A worked iTerm2 carrier (the `coralline-float` companion + setup steps) lives in
[`example/float-display-iterm2/`](example/float-display-iterm2/) — copy it into
your dotfiles and adapt. Other terminals (tmux, WezTerm, a menu-bar app, …) just
need to read `float.txt` the same way.

## Themes

| | |
|---|---|
| **`claude-coral`** — steel blue · mauve · Claude coral (default)<br>![claude-coral theme preview](./assets/theme-claude-coral.png) | **`catppuccin-mocha`** — soft pastels on dark<br>![catppuccin-mocha theme preview](./assets/theme-catppuccin-mocha.png) |
| **`nord`** — arctic frost<br>![nord theme preview](./assets/theme-nord.png) | **`gruvbox-dark`** — warm retro<br>![gruvbox-dark theme preview](./assets/theme-gruvbox-dark.png) |

| **`reverie`** — soft pastels · plum text on warm-dark<br>![reverie theme preview](./assets/theme-reverie.png) | |

A theme is just a `.conf` file assigning `VL_BG_*` / `VL_FG_*` — copy one, change the colors,
and source yours from `coralline.conf` instead. PRs with new themes are welcome.
The wizard discovers themes automatically from `themes/*.conf` and nested collections such as
`themes/best-themes/*.conf`, so adding a theme file does not require editing `configure.sh`.

> **Adding a theme?** Copy an existing `.conf`, set every `VL_BG_*` / `VL_FG_*`
> (including `VL_BG_EFFORT`; `VL_BG_BAR` is optional — only grayscale palettes need
> it, to keep the classic bar readable), add its name to the `THEMES` list in
> [`tools/render-screenshots.py`](./tools/render-screenshots.py), re-run it to generate
> `assets/theme-<name>.png`, and add a row to the table above. Please **don't regenerate
> `hero.png`** — it's a fixed sampler of the original six themes, not a full catalog.

## Platform support

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| macOS | ✅ supported (works on the stock bash 3.2) |
| Linux | ✅ supported |
| Windows + Git Bash | ✅ supported — Claude Code runs the status line through Git Bash when it's installed |
| Windows without Git Bash | ❌ not yet — Claude Code falls back to PowerShell, which can't run the bash script ([roadmap](https://github.com/Nanako0129/coralline/issues)) |

> **Windows note:** install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (which bundles
> Git Bash) and `jq`, and coralline runs natively. A native PowerShell port for the no-Git-Bash
> case is on the roadmap. The render path is built to stay cheap under Git Bash's emulated
> `fork()` — one `jq`, one `git`, and no per-field subprocess spawning.

## Why it's fast

The statusline is just a local shell script: it makes no network or API calls and uses zero
tokens. Claude Code pipes the session JSON to it on stdin and renders whatever it prints.

It runs every second (`refreshInterval: 1`), so the script is built to be cheap on CPU: one
`jq` invocation extracts every field at once, and one `git status --porcelain=v2 --branch`
call provides branch, dirty state, and ahead/behind together. No `bc`, no per-field subprocess
spam. Works on stock macOS bash 3.2 and any Linux bash.

## Acknowledgements

The visual language of coralline — segmented pills, powerline transitions, the `⇡⇣` git
glyphs, gauges that shift color as they fill — is a loving tribute to
[Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) by
[@romkatv](https://github.com/romkatv), which set the bar for what a fast, beautiful prompt
can be. Thanks also to the wider [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) lineage
that started it all, and to [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) for the glyphs that make
the pill shapes possible.

As for the name: coralline algae build reefs one thin, colorful layer at a time —
and **coral·line** is exactly what this is: a line, in Claude's coral.
